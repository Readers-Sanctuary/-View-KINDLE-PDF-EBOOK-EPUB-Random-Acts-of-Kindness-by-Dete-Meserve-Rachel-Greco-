Linda’s Book Obsession Reviews “Random Acts of Kindness” “Inspiring True Stories” by Dete Meserve and Rachel Greco, March 26, 2019

WOW! WOW! WOW! Kudos to Dete Meserve and Rachel Greco, authors of “Random Acts of Kindness” for this inspirational, emotional, gratifying unique, and amazing collection of “Random Acts of Kindness”. These are short examples of people from all backgrounds, ages, occupations, and talents, who haven given from their hearts, not expecting anything back in return. These acts of kindness start to encourage others to pay it forward, and major positive changes take place. I don’t want to give any spoilers from these inspiring stories. I just want you to know after reading this ARC, I pre-ordered this on Amazon.

As I read each story, I was in tears, actually crying. I was just so touched to realize that there are so many good people wanting to make this world a better place. It was so refreshing to read about people doing good kind and thoughtful deeds, rather than the terrible news that we often hear every day. Also, people who were giving in one way or another felt a sense of purpose and accomplishment that they didn’t feel before. Somehow, being kind encouraged more kindness. “One good deed deserves another.” Being kind become contagious, and that is wonderful!! What a wonderful motivational and inspirational collaboration!!!!

I would highly recommend this inspirational and amazing book to everyone! Both Dete Meserve and Rachel Greco have also provided valuable inspirational quotes. This is a well-written book, with many vivid examples of people helping one another, being compassionate, respectful and kind.
